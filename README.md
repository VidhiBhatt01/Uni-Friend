<br>
A one-stop solution to help you ace your exam.

# Inspiration: 💡
- During exam prep, the majority of the time of students is wasted in finding the right resource. Also, finding the resources was a huge task on the college telegram channel. Hence, we developed this web app to make the process seamless.

# What is it? 🙄
- A platform where people can find well-curated material in one place.
- A platform through which you can access previous year's GTU question papers.

# How we built it? 👷‍♂️👷‍♀️
- Tech Stack: <br>
    Fronted = HTML5, CSS3, JS, Bootstrap, Swipper.JS, JQuery, AJAX Google fonts APIs, and Netlify for hosting. <br>
    Chatbot = Python, Deep Learning, Jinja templates, Flask, NLTK Libraries, PyTorch
- References: Stack Overflow, W3Schools

# Challenges we ran into: 🏃‍♂️
- Working with AJAX was a little challenging.
- Figuring out the tech stack without increasing the project's complexity was a significant task.
- One of the containers was causing overflow in the website. Debugging this issue consumed around 2 hours.

# Accomplishments that we are proud of: 🤩
- Building the initial prototype within 36 hours entirely from scratch.
- Successfully achieving the desired targets.

# What's next for Uni-Friend? 📈
- Smoother UI and complete responsiveness.
- Light and Dark Theme support.
- Deploying the chatbot model on the cloud.

##  👉 Note:

The project is a Prototype. So, while accessing the netlify website, only some demo stuff will work.
