A one step solution to help you ace your exam.

# Inspiration: 💡
- During exam prep, majority of the time of students is wasted in finding the right resource. Also, finding the resources was a huge task on the college telegram channel. Hence, we developed this web app to make the process seamless.

# What it is? 🙄
- A platform where people can find well curated material at one place.
- A platform through which you can access previous year GTU question papers.

# How we built it? 👷‍♂️👷‍♀️
- Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JS, Bootstrap, Swipper.JS, JQuery, AJAX Google fonts APIs and Netlify for hosting.
- References: Stack Overflow, W3Schools

# Challenges we ran into: 🏃‍♂️
- Working with AJAX was a little challenging.
- Figuring out the tech stack without increasing the complexity of project was a major task.
- One of the container was causing overflow in the website. Debugging this issue consumed around 2 hours.

# Accomplishments that we are proud of: 🤩
- Building the initial prototype within 36 hours entirely from scratch.
- Successfully achieving the desired targets.

# What's next for Uni-Friend ? 📈
- Smoother UI and complete responsiveness.
- Providing facility to schedule 1:1 session with faculty.
- An AI chatbot to solve doubts.
